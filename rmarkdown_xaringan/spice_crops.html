# What is a spice?

That which suits the taste!

# Ginger

*Zingiber officinale*

---

## Introduction

- Nepal has adopted National trade integration strategy (NTIS, 2010). The strategy has prioritized export promotion of 7 crops, among which spices (Cardamom, ginger) form a major portion.
- The aroma/flavor of zinger is due to volatile oils found in the rhizome.
- Ginger cultivation has primarily been a small farmer's cash incentivized approach in Nepal. However, ours is the fourth largest producer country of Ginger ($6^{th}$ based on export).
- The crop is traded as a fresh or dried product.

---

## Morphology and Botany

- Monocotyledonous
- Although a perennial crop, the crop's development occurs intermittantly thoughout its life cycle (typical of herbaceous perennials). They survive the unfavorable season as dormant underground structures.
- The pattern of aboveground vegetative growth makes it seem like a crop that has annual growth habit.
- The crops' rhizome is the economic part.

## Uses

- Cash crop for income generation of peoples in midhills.
- Easiness of mixing with other crop as intercrop.
- Fresh ginger is used as condiment in food.
- Dried ginger is used for medicinal purposes.
- Antiemetic, digestion enhancer, anti-cold, anti-bacterial, beneficial for diabetic patients, Gall stones, Arthritis, Hypertensive, and
cholesterol patients.
- Ingredient in many biscuits, beverages, candies, chocolates, perfumes, shampoo, etc.

---

## Varieties

- Two broad categories: "Nasay" and "Bosay"

&lt;img src="../images/vegetables/Kapurkot-1_ginger.jpg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;&lt;img src="../images/vegetables/Kapurkot-2_ginger.jpg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Climate and soil

- Warm and humid climate with average temperature of `\(25-30^oC\)` favors better growth.
- Requires relatively less rainwater during germination, and a more frequent and intense one afterwards.
- One month prior to harvest, moisture supply should be halted.
- Grown successfully areas with elevation of 2000 masl where annual rainfall ranges 1500-2700 mm.
- Requires relatively warmer temperature for intital vegetative growth.
- Growth is checked at temperature below `\(15^oC\)`.

---

## Manuring and fertilization

- Urea: 6 kg, DAP: 11 kg, MoP: 5 kg per ropani
- FYM: 1500 kg per ropani
- Soil pH: 6-7
- Loam, sandy loam with ample organic matter content.
- Nutrient exhaustive crop, so crop rotation should be followed.

---

## Propagation

### Rhizome

- They are the storage organ of the plant.
- Are spread horizontally along the surface.
- Reach 15cm and 5cm in length and width respectively.
- Suckers arise from the buds of rhizomes.
- Rhizome contains 1-2% oil.

### Suckers

- Psuedostem sucker, since the erect form is due to leaves.
- Leaves arise from the base of the stem.
- Suckers vary in length and numbers based on variety.

---

## Land preparation and planting

- Land preparation started with start of monsoon season.
- Plouging 3-4 times.
- FYM incorporated into the soil at the time of final ploughing.
- In lowlands/"besis", where soil moisture is not a problem, planting may be done on Falgun-Chitra.
- Rhizome yield is less if planting is delayed beyond Basisakh 15.
- Although flowers, no fruit is formed.
- Rate of seed rhizome(20-60 g, 5-7 cm length):
- Large types: 300 kg per ropani
- Small types: 200 kg per ropani

---

## Planting and spacing

- Two lines per ridge can be accomodated.
- R-R: 30 cm, P-P: 25 cm
- Rhizome is placed 3-4 inches below the surface.
- Drainage channels 10 cm deep and 40 cm wide are dug in between ridges.
- However many nodes are present, only one will produce actively growing bud, when planted.

---

## Seed rhizome treatment

- Dithane M-45 or Endofil M-45 @25 g + Bavistin @10 g + 10 ltr water solution used for dipping rhizomes for 30 minutes.
- Rhizomes are shade dried and treated with Trichoderma viridae biofertilizer.

---

## Mulching

- Soon after planting, field is mulched with 8-10 cm thick mulch.
- Mulching is best done with sawdust. Other materials: dry leaves, rice hull, fresh leaves, grasses straw, etc.
- Advantages of mulch: erosion control, protection against extremes of environmental factors, protection against pest and diseases.

---

## Maturity and yield

- Harvested when maximum price can be fetched for given stage of ginger in between 7-9 months.
- For dried ginger production harvest can be delayed, but fibrousness increases as time passes. 
- Harvesting delayed to even later for seed rhizome production.
- Early stage fresh ginger: 600 `\(kg\ ropani^{-1}\)`
- Dried ginger: 1000 `\(kg\ ropani^{-1}\)`

---

## Diseases

- Upto 40% yield loss is due to diseases.
- Rhizome rot
  - Is highly pervasive, can infect any stage. New emerging buds have water soaked spots, Yellowing starts from the base of pseudostem
and goes along the both margins of leaves. In advanced stages, rhizome shows soft rot.
  - Is caused by *Pythium aphanidermatum*, *Pythium graminicolum* and other Pythium species.
  - Control: Select rhizomes with signs of healthy pith, use of resistant cultivars: ZI-9721, Crop rotation, provision of good
drainage, seed treatment, Spray of Bavistin + Redomil 0.2% a.i (1:1) + Brassica oilseed cake @ 2 `\(t\ ha^{-1}\)`.
- Yellowing disease: *Fusarium oxysporium f.*sp. *zingiberi*
- Leaf spot: *Phyllosticta zingiberi*
- Wilt: *Ralstonia solanacearum*
- Storage diseases: *Alternaria*, *Aspergillus*, *Rhizoctonia*

---

## Insects

- Borer: 
  - Drills hole in the pseudostem and progresses to top. Dead heart symptom. For chemical control, Thiomethoxam 25% w.g 0.2 `\(g\ ltr^{-1}\)` water, or imidachloprid 17.8% s.l 0.25 `\(ml\ ltr^{-1}\)` at an interval of 15 days at least twice. Light traps can control population of mature Moths.
- Rhizome fly: 
  - Maggots are the damaging stage.
- White grub
- Red ant

---

## Climate and soil

- Optimum temperature($\ ^oC$): 9-26/17
- Soil type: Well drained sandy loam
- pH: 6.0
- Light: Full sun loving
- Requires moderate to high amount of soil nutrients.

## Land preparation

- Well prepared seedbeds, raised or flat, improve uniformity of sowing depth, subsequent emergence and seedling development.
- Raised beds contribute to increase temperatures in cold seasons, and can reduce growing periods.

---

## Propagation

- By seeds.
- May also be transplanted apart from raising direct seeded, if germination conditions are not suitable. Not necessary, typically.

## Seed handling and sowing {.scrollable}

- In order to result uniform plant stand, seeds are coated with fine clay, to result in pellets of uniform size, shape and weight.
- A period of dormancy necessitates that seed be stored (usually for 1 years) before sowing. Germination is improved by low temperatures and higher light intensity.
- Sown at shallow depth (10-12 mm) in order to hasten emergence and minimize soil impedance.
- Spacing: 60-70 cm (R-R) x 5-10 cm (P-P)
