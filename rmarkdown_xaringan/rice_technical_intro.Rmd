# Introduction

## Crop cultivation and production

- Where in Nepal?
- Almost all districts
- In locations ranging 50 to 3050 masl.
- Rice-Maize production system
- Rice-Wheat production system
- Spring rice
- Bhadaiya rice
- Out of the total of 1,531,494 ha rice area in Nepal (Adjusted for rice cultivation area in year 2011/12, reported by MoAD), 70% is in the Terai, 26% in the hills and 4% in the mountains.

## Seed production

## Production economics

- Research report from ANZDEC (2002) reported the production function for rice yield with respect to fertilizers being best explained by a quadratic equation with baseline yield of 2.6 mt/ ha, the first degree polynomial term had a coefficient on fertilization (by NPK) of $11.23\ kg\ rice\ kg^{-1} fertilizer$ and the quadratic term showed the contribution of $\pm 0.04\ kg\ rice\ kg^{-1}\ fertilizer$.

- The study assumed that farmers would indisciminately use 145 kg of NPK per hectare to obtain a case controlled scenario. {But if we consider the marginal value productivity of fertilizer uses, farmers can hardly apply 69-73 kg of fertilizer per hectare if the unit price of fertilizers is around Rs. 15 per kg. Hence unless the condition of trade improves with farmers in terms of the output/input prices, they may not supply any more output.}

## Cropping system

- Tillage and crop establishment methods, residue management and nitrogen levels affect the crop and water productivity and profitability of wheat production^[Evaluation of different tillage and crop establishment methods for wheat cultivation in Rice-Wheat system in the terai tegion of Nepal, Nepal Agric. Res. J. Vol. 14, 2014].

- Field experiments to evaluate conventional tillage (CT), permanent raised bed (PRB) and zero tillage (ZT) under residue retention and residue removal with three nitrogen levels ($0$, $100$ and $120\ kg\ N\ ha^{-1}$) in wheat on productivity, irrigation water saving and productivity, and profitability were carried out from 2010 to 2012 in rice-wheat cropping system. 

- The experiments were carried out in strip split plot design with three replications. Zero till wheat produced significantly higher grain yield ($2616.5\ kg\ ha^{-1}$), irrigation water saving ($34\%$), irrigation water productivity ($3.35\ kg\ m^{-3}$), and B:C ratio (1.82), as compared to conventional tillage, over two years. Tillage and crop establishment costs were the lowest for ZT ($NRs\ 2275.92\ ha^{-1}$) followed by PRB ($NRs\ 5380.24\ ha^{-1}$) and CT ($NRs\ 7012.5\ ha^{-1}$). While, PRB produced slightly lower grain yield ($2163\ kg\ ha{-1}$), but, the highest water saving ($40.6\%$), comparable water productivity ($2.1\ kg\ m^{-3}$) and higher B:C ratio (1.55) than CT. Net income, $NRs\ ha^{-1}$ , from ZT, PRB, and CT were $35733$, $23641$, and $15830$, respectively.
